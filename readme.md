Welcome to the Pardot CCE Debugging test.  To get started, you will need to do the following:

1) Clone this repo

2) Create a new twitter account and link it to tweetbot.py (or use your own, if you don't mind some nonsensical tweets)

3) Install Python (any version)

4) Install the library twython (we recommend using pip to do so)

5) Try to run tweetbot.py... You will have some errors

6) Debug tweetbot.py WITHOUT modifying tweets.txt.  It should reach the end of tweets.txt, skip anything it cant tweet, and log what was and wasn't tweeted and why.  Then u pload to a new github repo.

7) Include the URL to your new repo in your response to mary.baldwin@salesforce.com
